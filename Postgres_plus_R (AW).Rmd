First, we need to establish a connection with our database. For this, we will use the RPostgres and 

```{r}
library(DBI)
library(RPostgres)
library(tidyverse)
options(scipen = 999)
```

Now, we'll create our connection.
```{r}
con <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(),      # Use the postgres driver
                 dbname = 'prescribers',     # Name of the database we want to connect to
                 host = 'localhost',         # 'localhost' or eg. 'ec2-54-83-201-96.compute-1.amazonaws.com'
                 port = 5432, 
                 user = 'postgres',
                 password = 'postgres')
```

We can see the tables in the database.
```{r}
dbListTables(con)
```

We can even see the columns of a particular table.
```{r}
dbListFields(con, 'drug')
```

To execute a query, we can use the dbSendQuery function
```{r}
# proportion of opioid prescriptions (step 1)
query = "SELECT f.fipscounty, f.county , SUM(total_claim_count) as total, population
FROM drug AS d
INNER JOIN prescription AS p2
USING (drug_name)
INNER JOIN prescriber AS p1
USING (npi)
INNER JOIN zip_fips AS z
ON p1.nppes_provider_zip5 = z.zip
INNER JOIN fips_county as f
USING (fipscounty)
INNER JOIN population as p3
USING (fipscounty)
WHERE f.state = 'TN' AND opioid_drug_flag = 'Y'
GROUP BY f.fipscounty, f.county, population
ORDER BY total DESC;"

res <- dbSendQuery(con, query)
```

Then to retrieve the results, we can use dbFetch. Note that you can fetch only a portion of the results if needed, but we'll fetch everything.
```{r}
prescribers <- dbFetch(res)

# It is good practice to clear the result after fetching what you need in order to free all resources associated with the result set. 
dbClearResult(res)
```

The results that are returned come through as a dataframe, so we can manipulate it using tidyverse.
```{r}
# prescribers %>% 
#   filter(nppes_provider_city == 'NASHVILLE')

# oroportion (step 2)
prescribers1 <-prescribers %>%
  mutate(opioid_proportion = total / sum(total) * 100,
         pop_proportion = population / sum(population) * 100,
         opioid_per_pop = total / population) %>%
  arrange(desc(opioid_per_pop))

prescribers1 %>% 
  head(15) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=opioid_per_pop, y=reorder(county, opioid_per_pop))) + geom_col()

```
```{r}
# explorting overdose deaths by county
query = "SELECT SUM(overdose_deaths), fipscounty
FROM overdose_deaths
GROUP BY fipscounty;"

res <- dbSendQuery(con, query)
```

```{r}
overdose <- dbFetch(res)

# It is good practice to clear the result after fetching what you need in order to free all resources associated with the result set. 
dbClearResult(res)
```

```{r}
# prescribers %>% 
#   filter(nppes_provider_city == 'NASHVILLE')

#proportion (step 2)
overdose1 <-overdose %>%
  left_join(prescribers1, by = "fipscounty") %>% 
  mutate(prop_deaths = sum / population * 100)

overdose1%>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = opioid_per_pop, y = prop_deaths)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_log10()
  
```
```{r}
cor(overdose1$opioid_per_pop, overdose1$prop_deaths)
```


```{r}

library(colorspace)

library(ggiraph)
```

```{r}

overdose1 <- overdose1 %>% 
  mutate(county = str_replace_all(county, " ", ""))

future_tibble <- tn_county %>% 
  inner_join(overdose1, by = "county")
